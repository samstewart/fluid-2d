% solves a poisson equation using jacobi method.
% We allow the user to specify two parameters that distinguish between the
% poisson equation for dissipation and the poisson equation for pressure.
function interior_solution = solve_poisson_equation(grid, b, dx) 
    % we do 35 iterations to solve the equation.
