/**
The general idea:
The Fragment Shader or Pixel shader is what renders the graphics to the screen.

Tasks broken down into pieces:

Big goal:
- Write fluid solver
- Write code to solve via stepping
	- Make data types for the various fields
		- pressure texture
		- velocity texture
		- force texture
		- density texture (or particle texture)
	- Make fragment programs or pixel shaders for each operation
		- advect (velocity field)
		- advect (density or particle field)
		- dissipate
		- divergence of velocity field
		- pressure solve
		- pressure project
		- force apply
		- structure so that we can include base code
		- handle boundaries
			- add 1px boundary to crate image or use convenience function like authors of haxiomatic do.

- Write code to visualize the fluid solver
	- Visualize a scalar field [ Done ]
		- Just write GSL shaders with color [ Done ]
		- Write GSL shader from custom texture [ Done ]

	- Visualize a vector field
		- How do they store the vecor field?
			- Store position in first two coordinates, and vector in second two coordinates. They visualize velocity as just RG = xy of velocity field.
			They add some slow decay of .99.
		- How do they represent the fluid?
			- Fluid as a texture. I think the coordinates are [-1, 1]^2 * fluidScale for the real space?

		- How do they render multiple things on screen? Multiple textures? [ Done ]
			This appears to be the trick: multiple frame buffers which are double buffered. There is a similar feature in Three.JS called WebGLRenderTarget. Maybe I can construct something double buffered with this?

			You need the double buffered thing so that we don't overwrite the data as we're processing it?

			One then binds a shader to this renderer. We render a quad into each of the render targets which contains our textures

			How to do this:
			https://github.com/haxiomic/GPU-Fluid-Experiments/blob/master/Source/GPUFluid.hx
			https://github.com/haxiomic/gltoolbox/blob/master/gltoolbox/render/RenderTarget2Phase.hx

			http://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fundamentals.html on Framebuffers

			Architecture:
			Main code -> Fluid -> RenderTarget -> Geometry -> Shader

			We have multiple render targets and each one has a quad. The render targets can swap between two textures that they use as render targets, and the shader has access to both. The shader does the actual computation while the render targets just handle rendering. 

	- Visualize a scalar field [ Done ]
	- Add mouse interactivity.
	-	We want to shade the velocity field 
	- How do they add the cool texture when you move the mouse?
		Use some kind of fractional projection to see if point lies in the path of the mouse?
	- Visualize particles
		- Store the particles with points and positions [ Done ]
		- Draw particles as points [ Done ]
		- One shader for advecting the particles
		- One shader for drawing the particle (need to include mouse interaction to change the color). 
		- Need to use UV coordinates to map lower resolution texture to full screen simulation (if I don't want resolution of the screen
		to be the resolution of my grid).

		-> How the particle rendering works:

		1. texture for velocity and particle velocity
		2. update particle texture with shader (adds damping)
		3. use vertex shader to update particle positions (UV mapping does the coordinate conversion)

		Q: How do UV coordinates work?
		Q: why is the advection different when solving the equation?
		Q: what are the various coordinate systems that are interacting?

		Test: 
		constant velocity field straight up
	
		-> Particle rendering TODO list
		1. finish moving all particle ownership to fluids [ done ] 
		2. add renderer for particle colors [ done ]
		3. test with constant velocity field
		4. make certain coordinate systems align.



% TODO: 
Backing up to the level of GPUComputationRenderer, I needed to do a serious refactor. 

The big idea is that we are essentially converting from the categories of Objects to the categories
of textures (full on data structure conversion).
1. Pull all code for the variables out into their own class.
2. Enable dependencies for initializing variables
3. Enable cyclic dependencies (not possible when initializing, but possible when computing). 
Probably easiest way is to simply recompile the shader every time. Stupid to have only one initialization step.
This is duplicated effort since we don't need to recreate a graph of objects.
4. We need a variable name for each variable since we can't deduce it from the code (easily).

Up to the level of GPGPU protoplanet:
1. I need to generate textures filled with appropriately scaled random numbers. Probably easiest to do as data texture.
Look at the createTexture class for boilerplate code on how to do this. 
2. Rewrite other GPUComputationExamples using my new framework.

Up another level:
1. Would be nice to have a tool for visualizing the various variables when debugging. Somehow arrange
them in a grid? Can we place the textures in a grid. Will be crucial for debugging the fluid stuff.

This should all be merged back into the main branch of THREE.js. The key argument will be code conciseness. 
We should be able to eliminate a ton of complexity.

The central idea is that we should be able to interact with the shader platform as if we are doing 
object oriented programming. Managing the various variables should be essentially automatic.

Back to the original fluids problem:

We don't need the model matrix or the projection
2. Change code so that final particle positions are in clip space. Really only need two coordinate systems:
	Clip space
	Sim space
Let the rendering framework take care of translating. 

Bundle all shader code into one JSON file

Problem: We store the particle positions and velocities in a texture.
Indexing into the texture with UV coordinates appears to be causing some distortion due to numerical error
(we are trying to compute 1/3).

The issue is apparently only at the boundary tiles? At least that is the appearance for large values of N.

Todo: fix the strange issue when doing passthrough particle step.

/**
Generate constants for the various coordinate systems.

## Coordinate Systems (outwards in)

1. Window coordinates 
	
2. Camera coordinates

3. World Coordinates

4. Body Coordinates

5. UV / texture coordinates

6. Fluid coordinates
	- One texture pixel for every grid cell.
	- Downsample from full window size since too computationally expensive.
	- One grid cell in fluid space is 100 units (PDE coordinates). Then one texel correponds to 100 units in fluid space.
	- Should be centered at the origin

7. Particle coordinates
	- One pixel in texture for every particle. Each pixel has particlePosition, particleVelocity. 
		particlePosition is in body coordinates for the particle.
	- Should be centered at the origin

We have two main coordinate systems:

Related by scale:
	World coordinates
	Window coordinates
	Fluid world
	Particle coordinates

Related by affine transformation:
	Texel and particle body coordinates

TODO:
	Convert initial conditions computation to intial conditions shader
	No need to recreate the wheel on this.
	Submit new GPUComputationRenderer to Three.js

Conversion to image coordinates is just a scaling on two levels: cell size and fluid scale.

Cell size is the width and height of a single grid cell. If cell size is 32 inches, then we are
sampling the fluid every 32 inches.

In other words, one pixel in the image coordinates corresponds to a grid cell of size 32x32.
